\chapter{Executive Summary}

This report proposes developing an intelligent scale system for the Royal New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) to weigh dogs at their rescue centres. The system will integrate hardware and software technologies and utilise a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter, filter, Wheatstone Bridge, and Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to collect the dog's weight and send it to a back-end Firebase database management system. \\
\\
The system will also have web and mobile front-end interfaces, allowing users with internet access to monitor and update information on the dog's weight. The proposed system will provide an efficient and accessible way for users to weigh and monitor dogs, enabling SPCA to retrieve accurate measurements and reliable data in real-time to monitor the details of dogs. The report also considers non-technical aspects, including sustainability, data privacy, potential breach of Treaty obligations, and other ethical issues such as algorithm basis and unintentional consequences that will be considered during implementation. Overall, the proposed product will provide SPCA with an easy-to-use and efficient tool to measure the weight of dogs and update the database system.
