\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the proposed product is a pet weighing system that integrates hardware and software technologies that provides SPCA with a tool to monitor the weight of dogs. The system uses a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter, filter, Wheatstone Bridge, and Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller to collect the weight from the dogs and send it to our back-end Firebase database management system.

Additionally, the web and mobile front-end interfaces that we will support will allow users with internet access to monitor details and specifics about the uploaded dogs to the system. Users can weigh dogs using the designed tool, which will be reflected in the information on the web, providing an efficient and accessible way for users to weigh and monitor dogs.

Overall, the product will provide SPCA with an easy-to-use and efficient tool to measure the weight of dogs and update the database system. Combining hardware and software aspects will enable SPCA to retrieve accurate measurements and reliable data in real-time to monitor the details of dogs.
